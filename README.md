# Face Recognition Tool

First this tool is trained by taking the username and user snapshots. Then it uses K Nearest Neighbour(KNN) algorithm for facial recognition. 

## Steps:

1)Create a new file named "Data" in your current repository. All users data will be saved here.

2)Run the "FaceDataset.py" code using command prompt.

3)Enter your name and let the camera take your snapshots. Press 'q' to close the snapshot window.

4)Repeat steps 2 & 3 for all the users.

5)Now run the "FaceDetection.py" code using command prompt. You can now see your name being displayed with your picture.
